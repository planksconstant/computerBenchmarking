# computerBenchmarking
Couple of files that can be used to benchmark computers (working on this just to see the performance difference in a intel I5 chip and a Apple silicone M4 chip )

{This project will not be maintained regularly just a hobby project to see the performance difference in the 16 Gigs M4 Macbook Pro & 8 Gigs intel i5 Macbook pro 2019}


Feel free to create a pull request if you have algorithms that can do the same
